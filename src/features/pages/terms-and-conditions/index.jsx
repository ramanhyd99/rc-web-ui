            Random Capsule does not deal with medical or psychological
            emergencies. We are not designed to offer support in crisis
            situations - including when an individual is experiencing thoughts
            of self-harm or suicide, or is showing symptoms of severe clinical
            disorders such as schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions. In
            these cases, in-person medical intervention is the most appropriate
            form of help.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you feel you are experiencing any of these difficulties, or if
            you are considering or contemplating suicide or feel that you are a
            danger to yourself or to others, we would urge you to seek help at
            the nearest hospital or emergency room where you can connect with a
            psychiatrist, social worker, counsellor or therapist in person. The
            same applies in-case of any medical or psychological health
            emergency. We recommend you to involve a close family member or a
            friend who can offer support.
